# Role of glucocorticoids in the hippocampus
Glucocorticoid hormones (GC) play an important role in the central nervous system during normal daily activities as well as in stressful situations. Conversely, mental disorders related to stress like Major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are associated with impaired GC function and secretion.

The secretion of GC is controlled by the circadian rhythm, with the highest concentration accompanying the beginning of the active phase, and stressful events influencing this rhythmic release.

GCs bind to both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors (MR and GR, respectively), both of which have different functions and localizations in the brain. Nevertheless, both MRs and GRs are co-localized in the neurons of the hippocampus, where, once bound by a GC, they act as ligand-dependent transcription factors.

The GR and MR in the hippocampus are hypothesized to play a distinct role in circadian and stress-related physiology as well as cognition and behavior, but the molecular mechanisms and particularly which genes are regulated by either of the two receptors is still unclear. To identify the MR- and GR- regulated genes, a genome-wide study of the interaction between GR and DNA is needed. Furthermore, to establish the complete implications of GC signaling in the hippocampus, the identity of all MR- and GR-targeted genes ought to be determined (Mifsud et al., 2021).

In this study therefore, the team measured the interaction of MR and GR with the ratâ€™s hippocampal genome under baseline conditions (early morning (BLAM) and late afternoon (BLPM)) as well as after acute stress exposure in the form of a forced swimming test (FS30)).

The animals were killed right after stress exposure or according to the circadian schedule of the group they belonged to, and their hippocampal tissue was removed. Thus, it is important to note that for each condition (BLAM, FS30, BLPM) in each receptor group (MR, GR), a different animal was used. After collecting samples, ChIP-seq and RNA analyses were performed. For this analysis, we are focusing on the ChIP-seq data provided.

Our goal for this project was to recreate some of the analyses done, which included the plotting of the average number of significant peaks for each receptor, as well as Upset Plots to depict overlaps of MR and GR peaks across samples and conditions, which in the paper was done using Venn Diagrams. Furthermore, we did a differential binding analysis but applied clustering instead of the simpler Overlaps method and, on the basis of the clusters, a GO (Gene Ontology) biological analysis to investigate underlying biological processes.
